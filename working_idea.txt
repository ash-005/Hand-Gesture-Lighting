1. using openCV module from python packages to take gestures using laptop/mobile camera

2. using inbuit cvzone module 'HandTrackingModule's HandDetector
   we built the frame and get the hand recognizor

3. Once we get the hands identified using obj.findHands(frame)
   we then take the first element and pass it ias obj.fingersUp(obj2)
   to get the number of fingers help up by the user

4. We then pass the count of fingers. convert as string to pass as string to
   Arduino UNO to read the data we are sending. Encode it and its done.

5. To close the frame we have the ESC key as the way to close it.


6. cv2.destroyAllWindows ends the frame



=-----------------------------------------------------------------

for Arduino UNO code 

1. we have created a STRING variable to store the incoming data from the python source file (count of fingers)

2. we selected the channel as 115200 here, (serial moniter channel is CARRIAGE RETURN)

3. Inside the while loop we defien the LED pins and then we use 
   Serial.readStringUntil() to read the string till it reaches '\r'
   '\r' is the  carriage return character, it gets to the start of the	
   line before advancing to the next line 

4. we use if-else to perform the actions on LEDs

Next up we plan to make it wireless using NodeMCU 8266 
relay data from python to arduino via nodeMCU

NodeMCU based control
app based interface
more gesture
or 
Make it bluetooth based on the webApp
